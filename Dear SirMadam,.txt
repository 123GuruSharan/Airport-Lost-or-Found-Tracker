"Sir, in this Lost and Found Tracker project, my main contribution was implementing the event handling — which means I made the buttons work.

If you look at the interface, when the user fills in the details like ID, Name, Category, Date, and Location, and clicks the 'Add Item' button — I wrote the code that takes that data, validates it, and stores it into our custom HashTable in the backend.

Similarly, when the user enters an ID and clicks 'Search', I handled the logic that searches in the hash table and displays the matching result in the table below.

Lastly, the 'Show All Items' button — I coded the part that fetches all the data from the hash table and displays it properly in the grid view.

So overall, I connected the front-end input fields and buttons to the back-end logic and ensured that the user’s actions reflect accurately in the output."

"I worked mostly inside the AppFrame.cpp file, specifically in the functions OnAdd, OnSearch, and OnShowAll. These functions take user input, interact with the HashTable, and update the wxGrid for real-time display."

We used wxWidgets, which is a C++ library for creating cross-platform GUIs. It provides elements like buttons, text fields, and tables — all used in our project interface.

Great! You've done **exactly what your role (Person 2: Event Handler & Controller)** demands. Here’s how to **explain this confidently in your viva**, referring to your real code:

### 🗣️ **Viva Explanation (Referring to Actual Code)**

> *Sir, in this project, I was responsible for writing the logic behind the button functionalities. In the `AppFrame.cpp` file, I implemented three core event-handling functions: `OnAdd`, `OnSearch`, and `OnShowAll`. These are directly connected to the Add, Search, and Show All buttons that you see in the GUI.*
>
> * *In the `OnAdd` function, I extract all the values from the input fields like ID, Name, Category, Date, and Location using `GetValue()` methods. I validate the inputs, and if everything is correct, I add the item to the hash table using `hashTable.addItem(item);`. Then, I clear the input fields and show a success message using `wxMessageBox`.*
>
> * *In the `OnSearch` function, when the user enters an ID and clicks Search, I fetch that ID, pass it to `hashTable.searchItem(id)`, and if the item exists, I display all its details in a pop-up message box. Otherwise, I show “Item not found.”*
>
> * *In the `OnShowAll` function, I first clear the grid table, fetch all the items from the hash table using `getAllItems()`, and then populate the `wxGrid` row by row using `SetCellValue()`.*
>
> *These three functions are mapped to their respective buttons using `EVT_BUTTON()` inside the `wxBEGIN_EVENT_TABLE` macro. So whenever a button is clicked, the corresponding function is automatically triggered.*

### 🔧 Bonus if They Ask for Technical Details

#### 🔹 How do you connect buttons to functions?

> *I used `EVT_BUTTON(ID_ADD, AppFrame::OnAdd)` and similar macros inside the event table. The button IDs like `ID_ADD`, `ID_SEARCH`, and `ID_SHOW_ALL` are defined using enums.*

#### 🔹 What type is `Item`?

> *`Item` is a struct or class defined in the project that contains fields like `id`, `name`, `category`, `date`, and `location`, all likely as strings. It's used to store individual lost/found item entries.*

#### 🔹 What does `hashTable` refer to?

> *It is an object of the custom `HashTable` class defined in `HashTable.hpp`. It stores the lost & found items using hashing technique to allow fast search and insertion.*

#### 🔹 Why use `wxMessageBox`?

> *It provides a pop-up message dialog to confirm actions like successful addition, errors like empty fields, or display search results in a user-friendly way.*
